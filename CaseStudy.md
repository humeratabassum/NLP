1. Data Collection
Collect a dataset of emails labeled as "spam" or "not spam."

Example: Use publicly available datasets like the Enron Email Dataset or UCI Spam Dataset.

2. Text Cleaning
Remove HTML tags, special characters, URLs, numbers, and extra spaces from the email text.

Lowercase all words for uniformity.

3. Pre-processing
Tokenize the email text into words.

Remove stopwords like “the”, “is”, “in” which do not help classification.

Apply stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their root forms (e.g., "running" → "run").

4. Feature Engineering
Convert the processed tokens into numerical features using techniques like:

Bag of Words

TF-IDF vectors

5. Modeling
Train a machine learning model like Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes using the features to classify emails as spam or not spam.

6. Evaluation
Test the model on a separate test set.

Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to check model performance.

7. Deployment
Deploy the model as an email filtering API or integrate it into an email client to filter spam emails in real-time.

8. Monitoring and Model Updating
Monitor false positives and false negatives.

Regularly update the model with new email data to improve detection accuracy.
