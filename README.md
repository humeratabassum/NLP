# NLP
This repository serves as a hands-on playground for exploring and implementing various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and workflows.

Here’s a brief explanation for each step in this pipeline, aligned with your flow:

1. Data Collection
Gather raw textual data from sources like websites, databases, documents, or social media.

2. Text Cleaning
Remove noise from the text such as special characters, HTML tags, extra spaces, punctuation, and stopwords.

3. Pre-processing
Transform the cleaned text by applying tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, POS tagging, etc., to make it easier to analyze.

4. Feature Engineering
Convert text into numerical features using techniques like Bag of Words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT embeddings).

5. Modeling
Train machine learning or deep learning models on the feature vectors to perform the NLP task (e.g., classification, NER, translation).

6. Evaluation
Assess model performance using relevant metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) on a validation/test dataset.

7. Deployment
Integrate the trained model into a production environment or API for real-world usage.

8. Monitoring and Model Updating
Continuously monitor the model’s performance in production, retrain and update it with new data to maintain accuracy.
